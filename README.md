# COTD HUD

Shows division cutoffs + favorited players' times + histogram during qualifier, and allows browsing of past COTD qualifier and division results, along with some utilities.
You can also 'favorite' other players to see their current qualifying time, *live*, during the qualifying round.

This is a beta release. Things might break. (You can reload the plugin from the developer menu if need be.)

This plugin will use a lot of disk space, relatively speaking. Especially over time. Much of this (260 MB) is *all* of the TOTD thumbnails, which are downloading automatically in the background over a few hours.

## Feature Todo

- âœ… Feature parity w/ COTD Stats
- âœ… Histogram for live COTD
- âœ… BetterChat integration for COTD stats (`/{tell-}cotd`)
- ðŸŸ¦ First-install wizard (configure basic settings and optional stuff)
- ðŸŸ¦ COTD Historical Explorer
    - âœ… Sync system/workflow for downloading data from APIs
    - âœ… Sync TOTD historical index data | date -> mapUid
    - âœ… Sync COTD challenge (qualifiers) data | challengeIds, startDate timestamp
    - âœ… Refactor sync stuff to use different DBs (will consume fewer resources and do faster writing to disk)
    - âœ… Sync COTD qualifier raw data for times for histogram (ad-hoc)
    - âœ… Sync Map data (ad-hoc)
    - âœ… UI selection layout / styles
    - âœ… Draw Histogram (qualis)
    - âœ… Division browser
    - âœ… Search user in a COTD quali list
    - âœ… Other quali list filters
    - ðŸŸ¦ Search user all COTDs
    - âœ… (optional, default:off) sync all cotd quali times in bg
    - âœ… "Play this map" button
    - ðŸŸ¦ TMX link button
    - âœ… TM.IO link button
    - ðŸŸ¦ List all TOTD maps
    - ðŸŸ¦ In list: easy favorite-ing + easy click to play
    - ðŸŸ¦ show your own times / records (not totd but global) -- useful for playing all TOTDs
    - âœ… match results (KO rounds)
    - ðŸŸ¦ animated histogram replays
    - âœ… replay/snapshot download settings
- ðŸŸ¦ COTD Friends
  - âœ… Show who's playing this COTD and their times
  - ðŸŸ¦ BChat integration (`/track-cotd @XertroV`) (or `/add-cotd-friend`)
  - âœ… Highlight the player in historical/explorer UI
  - ðŸŸ¦ (live) Browse or view players in COTD + one-click add-as-friend
- âœ… Cache Player ID data (like name)
- âœ… Optimization: check current COTD data and don't re-request times unnecessarily -- should be cached once the COTD qualis are over.
- âœ… Optimization -- like above but for division cutoffs
- âœ… Migrate color gradient tool to standalone window via COTD explorer
- âœ… BetterChat integration for gradients `/rgb 28f f28 hey here's my msg` would apply a gradient from `$28f` to `$f28` over `hey here's my msg`.
- ðŸŸ¦ color alias names for above `/rgb` command. (some done)
- âœ… Debug page: nod viewer quick access (but does't work for values??)
- ðŸŸ¦ About Page
- ðŸŸ¦ fix: LAB color gradients to take shortest path to avoid going the 'long way round'
- âœ… bug: clear divisions on new cotd
- âœ… bug fix: restart on new COTD (halts and doesn't update)
- ðŸŸ¦ export binary data to json files (to make it easy for ppl to use it if they want to).
- âœ… match results
  - âœ… sync comps, rounds, matches
  - âœ… check if results were incomplete
  - âœ… store results in individual files (~60 match results loads in ~20ms)
- âœ… bug: long cotds break (b/c nplayers==0 for so long?)
- âœ… bug: when loading cotd hud data and times are queued to be cached: the hud does not reload after they have been cached.
- âœ… quali rank vs div rank delta (a value of +-64 for each player showing improvement or not in ranking)
- ðŸŸ¦ Browse players / favorites
